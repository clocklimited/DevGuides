#Working with Sublime

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a popular, feature rich text editor.

---

## Must Have Settings

These settings are a must, to conform to Clockâ€™s coding standards. These settings should be place in you Sublime `User` folder.

Standard Settings:

```json
{
  "dictionary": "Packages/Language - English/en_GB.dic",
  "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true,
  "rulers":
  [
    80
  ],
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true
}
```

If you are working with Jade files, ensure you have a Jade syntax specific settings file:

```json
{
  "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": false
}
```
