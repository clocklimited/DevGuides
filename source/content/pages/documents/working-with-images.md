# Working With Images

Images can affect a website’s performance a great deal if not used correctly. This document outlines some key concepts to ensure all images are produced in the most optimal way possible.

## Saving SVG files from Illustrator

The default Illustrator settings don't lend themselves well for images to be used on the web. Ensure your setting match the screenshot below before saving any files.

## Optimising Images

Before you commit an image file, ensure it has been optimised fully. There are a few tools which will aid with this.

### [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)

Combines multiple tools into a simple drag-and-drop interface to optimize compression parameters, remove junk metadata and unnecessary color profiles. This should be used on all image files.

*Note: Images can be optimised multiple times using ImageOptim. Keep pressing the “Again” button until all images have crosses next to them, sinifying they cannot be further optimised.*

###[ImageAlpha](http://pngmini.com/)

Greatly reduces file sizes of 24-bit PNG files (including alpha transparency) by applying lossy compression and conversion to a more efficient PNG8+alpha format. Not suitable for all PNGs so keep an eye on the quality.
