        > Jade â€“ robust, elegant, feature rich template engine for nodejs.

        Jade is a high performance template engine implemented with JavaScript for node.

        It allows HTML to be written in an incredibly minimal format, relying on indentation and nesting to create document structure. This saves a lot of time and effort. It also helps negate issues with missing closing tags.

        ###### Basic Jade Document:

            !!!5
            html
              head
                meta(charset='utf-8')
              body
                .wrapper
                  h1 Jade Example
                  p Mauris iaculis porttitor posuere praesent id metus.
                  img(src='image.jpg', alt='Image Description')

        ###### Compiled HTML Document:

            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
              <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
              </head>
              <body>
                <div class="wrapper">
                  <h1>Jade Example</h1>
                  <p>Mauris iaculis porttitor posuere praesent id metus.</p>
                  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image Description" />
                </div>
              </body>
            </html>

        ## Features

        Jade adds many features which ease HTML development, including mixins, includes, variables, iteration and conditionals.

        For a good introduction to Jade, try the [interactive demos](http://naltatis.github.io/jade-syntax-docs/). For more detailed information, read the [official Jade documentation](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade#readme).

        ## Formatting

        When writing Jade, always use single quotes for speed and consistency. When compiled, these get swapped out for the more HTML familiar double quotes.

        Be aware that Jade is a whitespace significant language. This means that sometimes it is essential to leave spaces at the end of lines. Be sure that these don't get stripped by your text editor.

        When adding inline elements within other elements, spacing can become confusing. In the following example, `<em>emphasised text<em>` is being added mid-sentence. This means a trailing space is needed after the word 'with', and we need a double space before 'in' to ensure space after the `<em>`.

            p This is a sentence with 
              em emphasised text
              |  in the middle.

        Comments come in two variations in Jade. Using `//` to start a line converts the comment to and HTML comment in the compiled code. Using `//-` to start a line keeps the comment in the Jade only. The second version if preferred as it allows for fuller, more detailed commenting in files, without increased filesize for the compiled code.

        HTML which has been compiled using Jade is often minified, with all unnecessary whitespace stripped. This can occasionally lead to confusion when styling consecutive elements using `display: inline-block;`, as spacing between elements is affected by the presence of, or lack of, HTML whitespace.
