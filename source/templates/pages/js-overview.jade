        ## Overview

        * Use of the `<button>` element is preferable in places. We generally use these in place of links when there is no fallback href attribute â€“ usually when triggering JS functionality with no required level of fallback.

        * jQuery, zepto etc
        * Modernizr, inc, rules for adding modules when needed
        * common plugins: break.js
