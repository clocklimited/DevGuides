        * Some fascinating aspects about building emails
        * Attempts to not winge about email clients rendering things dissimilarly

        ## Design

        1. _"Keep your emails to a fixed width of no more than 550-600 pixels"_  
          <small><cite>- [campaignmonitor.com](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/)</cite></small>
        
        2. _"The average preview pane is around 300-500 pixels high, so make sure you include any important bits of your email in this area"_  
          <small><cite>- [campaignmonitor.com](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/)</cite></small>

        3. Don't shy away from custom fonts- but don't forget to provide a fallback

        ## Structure

        1. __Use `<table>` regularly and often__ \(or just pretend you're back in the 90s)
          * Microsoft Outlook uses it's own Word markup processing engine. `<div>` tags therefore won't be rendered correctly. 
          * Some legacy browsers strip the root element unless it is a `<table>` tag

        2. __Strip any common semantics__ (e.g. `<h1>`, `<>` etc)
          * Some browsers render semantic markup in green. It baffles us too.

        3. __Use double__ `<br/><br/>` __instead of__ `<p>` __tags__
          * Some clients render margins and padding on paragraph tags, whereas line-breaks are consistently rendered across all clients
          * Font styles can be declared once in the parent `<td>` rather than every `<p>`
          * Better readability of content, like in the below example

                  <table>
                    <tr>
                      <td style="font-size:12px; color: #888;">

                      Welcome to the world of HTML emails.
                      <br><br>

                      (Isn't it so much fun?)
                      <br><br>

                      </td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>

        4. __Don't use the `mailto` prefix in your links__  
          * Some email clients see your email as spam!

        ## Styling

        1. Avoid using `float` in your inline styles markup. [Outlook.com](http://outlook.com) recently dropped support, so it won't be long 
        before others do so too! If you want something 'floated' right, stick to using `align='right'` on your `<td>`.

        2. Replace `margin` and `padding` with `cellspacing` and `cellpadding` - same reason as above
        
        3. Inline comments - some browsers strip `<style>` tags

        4. `table[class="table-class"]` - Yahoo! Mail

        5. If embedding an external `font-family`, use `@import` rather than `<link>`- it'll work on Android that way

        6. Don't use shorthand CSS values (e.g. `color: #eee`, `font: Arial 12px`)

        7. Use the `bgcolor='#EEEEEE'` attribute rather than `style='background: #eeeeee'  
        \- just for consistency, only give background colours via parent `<td>` tags

        ## Can I use `@media` queries?
        You sure can. The vast majority of mobile email clients now support it!

        For an up-to-date chart on `@media` compatibility, check out [Campaign Monitor](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/guides/mobile/#mobile-support).
